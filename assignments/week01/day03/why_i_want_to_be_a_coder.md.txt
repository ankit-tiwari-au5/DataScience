Hi, 

My name is Ankit Tiwari and I have done the engineering in E&Tc.
So, I want to be a coder there are many reasons for that 
1)Their thought process is crystal clear means they are linear thinkers
which is the first aspect if you know in life that what you have to 
achieve you have already reached there and its just about the hardwork
that you are going to put.
2)It teaches you to be patience
3)They are Adaptable to any surroundings
4)Effieciency
I love that this profession has provided a platform to develop valuable 
personal characteristics that will help me to not only become a better programmer but a more effective human, too! 

Also, attainU providing me this opportunity to reach and accomplish the goals.
I am also loving the course at the moment understand everything bit by bit.
